# fcc-personal_portfolio

## Description:
My second project for [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) is the
ubiquitous [personal portfolio webpage](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage).  The user stories restrict the functional part of the design to a basic single page site where everything is accessible by scrolling.  My first thought was to collapse the portfolio thumbnails behind a dropdown on mobile but in order to strictly satisfy the user stories I'll avoid that here.

## Project Rules:
1.  Don't look at the [example project's](http://codepen.io/hallaathrad/full/vNEPpL) code.
2.  Fulfill the user stories.  Use whatever libraries you need.  Give it your own personal style.

## User Stories:
*  I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
*  I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
*  I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built.  If you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.
*  I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

## Technology and Libraries:
*  Basic html/css.  This much should be obvious.
*  Once again, I will make use of bootstrap.  The layout system just makes things so convenient.
*  jQuery for the scrolling effect.
*  Social media icons provided under [Creative Commons (Attribution 3.0 Unported)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).  Sourced from [iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/black-white-social-media) and authored by [Alfredo](https://creativemarket.com/HighOnGraphics).
*  Placeholder images from [Lorempixel](http://lorempixel.com).

## Notes:
The social media icons don't actually link anywhere yet because I'm not quite ready to release that information.  Sorry!  I'm not incredibly hard to find if you really need to reach out to me.

Hosted on [codepen](http://codepen.io/xipxoom/full/aNVBmR/).

## Todo:
* Replace placeholder images with actual projects.
* Not thrilled with the footer.
* Social media icons can be edited to match the color scheme.
