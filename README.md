# fcc-personal_portfolio

## Description:
My second project for [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) is the
ubiquitous [personal portfolio webpage](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage).  The user stories restrict the functional part of the design to a basic single page site where everything is accessible by scrolling.  My first thought was to collapse the portfolio thumbnails behind a dropdown on mobile but in order to strictly satisfy the user stories I'll avoid that here.

## Project Rules:
1.  Don't look at the [example project's](http://codepen.io/hallaathrad/full/vNEPpL) code.
2.  Fulfill the user stories.  Use whatever libraries you need.  Give it your own personal style.

## User Stories:
*  I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.
*  I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.
*  I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built.  If you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.
*  I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

## Technology and Libraries:
*  Basic html/css.  This much should be obvious.
*  Once again, I will make use of bootstrap.  The layout system just makes things so convenient.
